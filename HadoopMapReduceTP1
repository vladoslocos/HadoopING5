// Code proposed by Vladimir Ignjatovic for the Hadoop MapReduce

/* Map function, sort data from csv file, attributing a number for every data from a line */

var csvData = ["elephant;pink","dog;red","cat;black"];
var i = 0;

var mappedData = csvData.map(function(mapper) {
	i ++;
	// Split every line by the ";" separator (well known and very used in csv file to separate cells in the project)
  	var arrayOfData = csvData[i].split();
  	// arrayOfData = ["elephant","pink"]; So "elephant" is associated to 0 and "pink" to 1

  	return arrayOfData;

});

console.log(mappedData); //[{"elephant", "pink"}, {"dog", "red"}, {"cat", "black"}]

/* Reduce function, in order to concatenate all the data by their key number (sorted by line) */
var j=0;
var reducedData = mappedData.reduce(function(reducer) {
	j++;
  	return reducer + mappedData[j] + ";"; // In order to keep csv format, in case if we want to export the data again

});

console.log(reducedData); // ["elephant;dog;cat","pink;red;black"];

//End of functions
